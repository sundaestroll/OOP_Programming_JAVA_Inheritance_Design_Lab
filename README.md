# OOP_Programming_JAVA_Inheritance_Design_Lab
This is an eclipse project I have done to pratice my Java inheritance skills.
There are one parent class, two subclasses under the parent class and another one under the subclass.
If you run the Hospital.java program you will get the final out come of what I have implemented in other subclasses.
Thank you
